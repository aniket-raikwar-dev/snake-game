# Snake Game üêç
Snake game using JavaScript, a classic game where the player controls a snake on a grid. The snake grows in length as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. The game includes smooth movement, responsive controls, and dynamic score tracking as the snake progresses. This project demonstrates strong foundational skills in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game loop logic, making it an excellent example of practical game development using web technologies.
